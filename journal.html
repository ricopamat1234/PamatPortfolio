            <a class="jjj">&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDuring my internship in OPEC company, located in Damosa Lanang,<br>
                Davao City. Opec company have six departments in every departments there is <br>
                different process or work system.Thanks to God that I'll passed until final interview.<br>
                The OPEC branch manager in Philippines asked me where department or process <br>
                I'll choose. I'll choose FNH department where this department focused on designing <br>
                both interior and exterior design of a house ,including 2D and 3D animation. This <br>
                company is a Japanese company thats why the software they used are all Japanese <br>
                software. It is very hard to learn for me, because I cannot understand the language <br>
                in software, the tools all function in the software are Japanese. First day of duty,  <br>
                I'll observe the process on how to design a house interior and exterior. Learn basic  <br>
                Japanese Language like greetings because the environment of the company adopt the <br>
                environment in Japan  workplace, the manners, discipline and most especially the <br>
                time management, the company  encourage to avoid lates and absents because the<br>
                Japanese people are strict in terms of time. I practice making a simple house design <br>
                first floor only. So that time, the tasked they give me is very challenging to me because <br>
                even if its simple but for me that is very hard to design, I cannot understand the text<br>
                and the tools, the employees told me that familiarization is the one way to understand <br>
                 and search it to google to get the answer all my question. I'm so glad and happy<br>
                 because all employees are willing to teach or to guide me in designing a house, <br>
                introduce a techniques and easy way to design a house.
